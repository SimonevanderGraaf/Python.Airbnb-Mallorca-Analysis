# Python.Instacart-Basket_Analysis
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Even though their sales are going well, they whant clear insights in their customer behaviour and sales patters. My task was to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of their orders, products and customers and suggest strategies regarding their price ranges, customer profiling and advertising. 
# Key Questions
- The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the
day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at
times when there are fewer orders.
- They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people
spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at
these times.
- Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to
use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of
product orders.
Note: Instacart is a real company that’s made their data available online. However, the contents of this project brief
have been fabricated for the purpose of this Achievement.

- The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
  - What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how
often do they return to Instacart)?
  - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
  - Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
  - Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering
habits?
  - What different classifications does the demographic information suggest?
Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
  - What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer
profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products
customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.
# Data
The following datasets have been used for this analysis:
- orders
- products
- aisles
- orders_products_prior
- departments
- customers (created by CareerFoundry for learning purposes)

**Important:**
The days in the column 'orders_day_of_week' from the ' orders' dataset are written in the following way:
- 0 = Saturday
- 1 = Sunday
- 2 = Monday
- 3 = Tuesday
- 4 = Wednesday
- 5 = Thursday
- 6 = Friday
# Tools
For this project I used Python and the following libraries:
- Pandas: for data analization
- Seaborn: for data visualization
- Matplotlib: for data visualization
- Numpy: for mathematical equations
- SciPy: for mathematical equations
# Folders
The project files are divided between the following folders:
- Project Management: Project Brief
- Data (Data files not uploaded to GitHub due to size.)
- Scripts: The Jupyter notebooks containing the coding for the analysis.
- Analysis: The visualizations used for developing and explaining insights.
- Sent to Client: The final report presented in Excel
