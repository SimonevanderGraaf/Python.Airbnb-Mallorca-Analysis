# Python.Airbnb-Mallorca-Analysis
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Even though their sales are going well, they whant clear insights in their customer behaviour and sales patters. My task was to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of their orders, products and customers and suggest strategies regarding their price ranges, customer profiling and advertising. 
# Research Questions
The questions that are explored in several analysis steps in Python are:
- Are the listings spread over the Island? Do most listings fall into a specific geographical category, for example next to the beach or in the mountains?
- What are the numbers of guests that book Airbnb a lot in Mallorca, Mostly duoâ€™s, big groups, in between the two or more or all sizes?
- What are the differences in prices and are listings of certain prices mostly booked?
- Does being a superhost have a lot of influence on bookings?
- The highest possible score of reviews is 5. Do reviews with a score lower than 3 have a lot of influence on the popularity of the listing?
- What is the relationship between property location and guest satisfaction?

The questions ultimately used for the full analysis in Tableau:
- What is the relationship between property location and guest satisfaction?
- Do listings that are close to the beach or have mountain view have influence on the location review scores?

# Data
The dataset contains information about all the Airbnb listings of Mallorca that have received reviews
in the past. There are almost 12000 listings and next to basic information such as id, name, url and 
location it has information about the host, the property, price and availability and information on 
the reviews of the listings.

The Inside Airbnb website shows that the data of Mallorca has been last updated the 23rd of March 
2024 and that in general it is updated every quarter. The data therefore stays up to date.
# Tools
For this project I used Tableau and Python with the following libraries:
- pandas & numpy - for data analysis
- seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn, and folium - for data visualization
- json and geojson - for spatial analysis
The business case with extra visualizations for this project were created in Tableau Public. It can be found here: [Airbnb Mallorca Business Case](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/simone.van.der.graaf/viz/ProjectAirbnbMallorca-CareerFoundry/Story1?publish=yes)  
# Sources
The dataset comes from Inside Airbnb, the database website from Airbnb. Given the fact that the 
source is from the company, the dataset is trustworthy.
